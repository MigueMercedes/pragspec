description: Pragmatic Spec-Driven Development pipeline. Invoke ALWAYS when receiving a task that touches code in this project before planning or implementing. Decides mode (FULL/FAST/SHORT-CIRCUIT) based on heuristics, loads the project SDD context, and directs to the corresponding pipeline. First invocation in a project also customizes the scaffolded CLAUDE.md template based on the actual codebase.

# Pragmatic SDD

This skill is the entry point of the SDD flow. Invoke it when starting any non-trivial task. It guides you to decide the mode of work, what docs to read, and when to write specs vs when not.

## When to invoke

- The user asks for any change to code (feature, bug, refactor, fix)
- Before touching files in the project
- Before invoking `superpowers:writing-plans` or `feature-dev:feature-dev` (this skill decides mode, those do the work)
- When a new session starts and you are not sure what process to follow

**Do NOT invoke** for pure conversational queries (questions about the codebase, "what does X do", "where does Y live"). For those use `Read`/`Bash` directly.

---

## First-time setup (if CLAUDE.md still has placeholders)

If the project's `CLAUDE.md` has unresolved `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` (recently scaffolded by `claude-sdd`), the FIRST thing to do is customize it:

1. **Read the codebase** to detect:
   - Primary language(s) and framework(s) (look for `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.)
   - Repo layout (monorepo, single-repo, multi-repo with submodules)
   - Test framework (look for `vitest.config`, `pytest.ini`, `jest.config`, etc.)
   - Linter / formatter
   - Deploy target (look for `Dockerfile`, `vercel.json`, `railway.toml`, `.github/workflows/`)

2. **Replace placeholders** in `CLAUDE.md`:
   - `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` → from `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, or directory name
   - `{{PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}}` → ask the user briefly if unclear
   - `{{STACK}}` → detected from above
   - `{{REPO_LAYOUT}}` → tree of top-level directories with one-line description each
   - `{{CONSTRAINTS}}` → ask the user 3-4 questions about product-specific constraints (auth provider? notification channels? compliance? performance budgets? browser support?)

3. **Detect & propose extensions.** Look at `specs/templates/feature.spec.md`:
   - Check the `<!-- Extensions enabled: ... -->` comment near the top, if any.
   - Run the heuristics below against the codebase. For each extension whose heuristic matches, propose it to the user.

   | Extension | Heuristic — propose if any are true |
   |---|---|
   | `multi-tenant` | Code or schemas reference `tenant_id`, `business_id`, `account_id`, `workspace_id`, or `org_id` as a foreign key / scope. |
   | `persistent-data` | Repo has `migrations/`, `alembic/`, `prisma/`, `drizzle/`, `schema.sql`, or an ORM dependency (sequelize, typeorm, prisma, sqlalchemy, alembic, gorm, diesel). |
   | `production-rollout` | Code references feature flags or environment-gated branching: dedicated SDKs (`launchdarkly`, `growthbook`, `unleash`, `posthog`, `flagsmith`), env-var gated `FEATURE_*`, or paired runtime modes that suggest staged rollout (e.g. an `environment` flag with values like `demo`/`real` or `sandbox`/`production`, plus a `dryRun` / `DRY_RUN` toggle used to gate writes). `dryRun` alone is not enough — there must also be an environment / mode distinction the code branches on. |
   | `operational` | Project has `Dockerfile` + observability deps (datadog, sentry, opentelemetry, prom_client) or a `runbooks/` directory. |
   | `external-deps` | Code calls third-party APIs (stripe, paddle, twilio, sendgrid) or has webhook handlers. |
   | `public-api` | Project is a library (no top-level app entry, has `main`/`exports` in `package.json`, or publishes to npm/PyPI). |

   - Show the user the proposed list with one-line rationale per match: "Propose `persistent-data` because alembic/ exists." Ask which to enable. Default = all matches.
   - For each confirmed extension, read the fragment at `specs/templates/extensions/<id>.md` and inject it into `specs/templates/feature.spec.md`. The merge:
     - **Removes** the `## Optional sections (extensions)` heading and the placeholder bullets directly under it (everything from that heading up to the next `##` heading) — these are a hint for empty installs and become noise once real fragments land.
     - Inserts the fragments in their place (concatenated, separated by blank lines).
     - Updates the `<!-- Extensions enabled: ... -->` comment near the top if it exists, or adds one immediately after the `> **Mode**: ...` header line if not.
   - If no extensions match, say so and skip — `feature.spec.md` stays lean.

4. If applicable, generate the first `docs/adr/0001-<area>.md` placeholder with the project context as a starting ADR

After this one-time setup, proceed with normal SDD flow below.

---

## Step 1: classify the mode

Apply this decision tree:

```
Does the change touch user-observable behavior?
├─ NO (typo, lint, comment, dep bump, config doc, file rename without ref change)
│  → SHORT-CIRCUIT
│
└─ YES
   ├─ Is it a bug fix with clear test failure or module with existing tests?
   │  → FAST
   │
   └─ It's feature/refactor/schema/integration/auth boundary
      → FULL
```

**If you doubt between FAST and FULL: choose FULL.** The overhead of full spec (~30 min) is much less than the cost of discovering gaps in post-merge review.

**If you doubt between SHORT-CIRCUIT and FAST: choose FAST.** If you are going to touch behavior, the minimal spec is worth it.

### Classified examples

| Task | Mode | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| "Fix typo in pricing page" | SHORT-CIRCUIT | Just a string, no behavior |
| "Bump httpx 0.27 → 0.28" | SHORT-CIRCUIT | Dependency, no API change |
| "Reset password rejects expired tokens with message X" | FAST | Bug, tested module |
| "Implement installment payments via Stripe" | FULL | Feature, external integration, billing |
| "Migrate to new schema for users" | FULL | Schema change, multi-tenant if applicable, legacy data |
| "Add notes field to entity X" | FULL | Schema change |
| "Refactor notification_service to support push" | FULL | Behavior change + new integration |
| "Rename `getUsers` → `listUsers`" | SHORT-CIRCUIT | No behavior |

---

## Step 2: read critical context

Regardless of mode, read BEFORE touching code:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — SDD philosophy, escape hatches, repo map, project constraints
2. **ADRs in `docs/adr/`** if your change touches active architectural patterns
3. **Existing specs** in `specs/features/<area>/` of the affected area (consistency, no-duplication)
4. **`TASKS.md`** if there is an associated ticket

For FULL/FAST: also read
5. **`SPEC_PIPELINE.md`** for the detail of each step

---

## Step 3: execute the corresponding pipeline

### FULL pipeline

```
1. SPEC      → use specs/prompts/spec-generator.md, output to specs/features/<area>/<slug>.spec.md
2. REVIEW    → use specs/prompts/spec-reviewer.md, edit the same spec with Review notes section
3. TESTS     → use specs/prompts/test-generator.md, respect Selective TDD
4. IMPLEMENT → use specs/prompts/implementation.md, respect project architecture
5. VERIFY    → use superpowers:verification-before-completion
```

For complex tasks (>1 day estimated, multi-file): invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` BEFORE Step 1. The resulting plan feeds the spec.

### FAST pipeline

```
1. SPEC minimal → only Context + Validation Rules + Edge Cases + Errors + Tests strategy. Output to specs/features/<area>/<slug>.spec.md anyway
2. TESTS        → failing-test-first if it's a bug, test-first if new validation
3. IMPLEMENT    → respect architecture and ADRs
4. VERIFY       → tests + lint + CI green
```

Skip formal review — review happens in commit message.

### SHORT-CIRCUIT pipeline

```
1. IMPLEMENT direct
2. VERIFY: existing tests pass + lint clean + CI green
```

Skip everything else. DO NOT write spec — would be noise.

---

## Step 4: applicable skills

Identify and use relevant skills based on the area of change:

| Your change touches... | Use skill |
|---|---|
| Project-specific patterns | Look for skills in `.claude/skills/` of your project |
| Bug debugging | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` |
| TDD enforcement | `superpowers:test-driven-development` |
| Verification at the end | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` |
| Brainstorming requirements | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| Multi-step plan | `superpowers:writing-plans` |

---

## Step 5: output format

### FULL/FAST

Your response when you complete the task follows this order:

```
## 1. SPEC
Path: specs/features/<area>/<slug>.spec.md
[link or summary of the spec]

## 2. SPEC REVIEW (FULL only)
Issues found, decisions taken

## 3. TEST CASES
List of tests written, with paths

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION
Summary of changes + paths of modified files

## 5. VERIFICATION
- Tests: <result>
- Lint: <result>
- CI: <link to run>
- Smoke (if applicable): <description>
```

### SHORT-CIRCUIT

Only:
```
## CHANGE
Diff summary + paths

## VERIFICATION
- Existing tests pass
- Lint clean
- CI: <link>
```

---

## Hard rules

- **Do not start implementing without classifying the mode**. Five minutes thinking the mode saves hours of reverting.
- **Do not write spec for SHORT-CIRCUIT**. It's noise and kills the discipline.
- **Do not skip VERIFY in any mode**. Even for SHORT-CIRCUIT, existing tests must pass.
- **If you find drift between spec and code during implementation**: update spec in the same commit. Drift without documenting is how SDD breaks silently.
- **If you doubt the mode, ask the user what they prefer**. A 30-second question vs 30 min of overhead.

---

## How to invoke downstream pipeline

When you've decided the mode, do not implement directly: invoke the corresponding prompt:

- For **SPEC**: read `specs/prompts/spec-generator.md` and apply
- For **REVIEW**: read `specs/prompts/spec-reviewer.md` and apply
- For **TESTS**: read `specs/prompts/test-generator.md` and apply
- For **IMPLEMENT**: read `specs/prompts/implementation.md` and apply
- For **VERIFY**: invoke skill `superpowers:verification-before-completion`

The prompt of each step has the project context already embedded after first-time setup, you don't need to re-explain it.
